I'm excited to introduce my new personal site, built with a unique **OS-brutalist** design philosophy that combines the raw, functional aesthetic of operating systems with modern web technologies.

## The Design Philosophy

Brutalism in web design embraces:

- **Functionality over form** - Every element serves a purpose
- **Raw materials** - Minimal styling, exposing the structure
- **Bold typography** - Clear, readable text at large sizes
- **High contrast** - Dark backgrounds with bright accents

## Technical Stack

This site is built with cutting-edge tools:

```typescript
const stack = {
  framework: 'React 19',
  language: 'TypeScript',
  bundler: 'Vite',
  state: 'Zustand',
  routing: 'React Router',
  styling: 'CSS Modules',
  hosting: 'Cloudflare Pages'
};
```

### Key Features

1. **Draggable Windows** - OS-style window management with smooth interactions
2. **Particle Background** - Subtle dust-in-light effect for ambiance
3. **Performance First** - Under 80KB gzipped, 60fps animations
4. **Full TypeScript** - Type safety throughout the codebase

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing insights on:

- Web performance optimization techniques
- React patterns and best practices
- Design systems and brutalist aesthetics
- Building high-performance UIs

Stay tuned for more posts exploring the intersection of design, performance, and modern web development.
